# Privacy Policy for Alright

**Last Updated:** February 7, 2026

## Overview

Alright is a mental health check-in app designed with privacy as a core principle. Your emotional data stays on your device and in your personal iCloud account—we never see it.

## What Data We Collect

### Data Stored on Your Device & iCloud (Not Accessible to Us)
- **Check-in data:** Your mood, energy, and anxiety ratings
- **Voice notes:** Audio recordings you create during check-ins
- **Text notes:** Written reflections you add to check-ins
- **Timestamps:** When you complete check-ins
- **Preferences:** Your name, wake time, bed time, and notification settings

This data syncs via Apple's iCloud if you have it enabled. We do not have access to your iCloud data.

### Data We Store on Our Servers
- **Push notification token:** A random identifier Apple assigns to your device so we can send you check-in reminders. This token cannot identify you personally.
- **Timezone and notification schedule:** So we send notifications at appropriate times for you.

That's it. We do not store your check-ins, mood data, notes, or any personal health information on our servers.

### Data Processed Temporarily (Not Stored)
- **Aggregated mood summaries:** When you request AI-powered insights, we send anonymized averages (e.g., "average mood: 3.2 this week") to generate personalized insights. This data is not stored and cannot identify you.
- **Approximate location:** If you enable weather context, we use your approximate location to fetch weather data. Location is never stored.

## How We Use Your Data

- **Push notification tokens:** To send you scheduled check-in reminders
- **Schedule preferences:** To time notifications appropriately
- **Aggregated summaries:** To generate AI insights (processed, not stored)

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties.

We use the following services:
- **Apple Push Notification Service (APNs):** To deliver notifications to your device
- **Anthropic Claude API:** To generate AI insights from anonymized, aggregated data (data is not retained by Anthropic)
- **Open-Meteo:** For weather data (receives only approximate coordinates, no personal information)

## Data Retention

- **On-device data:** Stored until you delete it or uninstall the app
- **iCloud data:** Managed by your iCloud settings
- **Push tokens:** Retained while you use the app; deleted when you uninstall or disable notifications
- **AI insight requests:** Not retained; processed and discarded immediately

## Your Rights

You can:
- **Export your data:** Download all your check-in data as a JSON file from Settings
- **Delete your data:** Remove all data from the app and our servers from Settings
- **Disable notifications:** Stop all push notifications at any time
- **Opt out of AI insights:** Use the app without ever requesting AI-generated insights

## Children's Privacy

Alright is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

## Security

- All data transmitted to our servers uses HTTPS encryption
- Push tokens are stored securely and cannot be used to identify you
- Your health data never leaves your device/iCloud except for anonymized AI insight requests

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy occasionally. We'll notify you of significant changes through the app.
